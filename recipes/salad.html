    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>This refreshing Caprese Salad</strong> is perfect as an appetizer or side dish. Start by slicing 
        fresh tomatoes and mozzarella into even, round pieces. Arrange them in alternating layers on a serving plate, 
        adding fresh basil leaves between each layer. This classic Italian dish is as beautiful as it is tasty.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Next, season the salad</strong> with a pinch of salt and black pepper to taste. 
        Drizzle extra-virgin olive oil over the entire plate, making sure each piece is coated lightly. 
        For an added depth of flavor, sprinkle a little balsamic vinegar over the salad or use a balsamic reduction.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Finish with a garnish</strong> of extra basil leaves, if desired. This salad is best served immediately 
        to enjoy the fresh, vibrant flavors. Caprese Salad makes a great light starter or can be enjoyed on its own 
        as a refreshing, healthy snack.
