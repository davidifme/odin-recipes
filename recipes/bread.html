    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>For this classic garlic bread</strong>, start by preheating your oven to 180°C (350°F). 
        Slice a baguette or loaf of Italian bread in half lengthwise, then place the halves on a baking sheet, cut side up.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Next, make the garlic butter</strong> by mixing softened butter, minced garlic, and chopped parsley in a small bowl. 
        Spread this mixture generously on each bread half, covering the surface evenly. 
        This will ensure each bite has a rich garlic flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Once ready to bake</strong>, place the bread in the oven for about 10–15 minutes or until it’s golden and crispy. 
        For a little extra crisp, you can broil it for a minute or two at the end. Serve warm as a side dish or appetizer.
