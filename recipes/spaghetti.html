    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>To make a delicious spaghetti dish</strong>, start by boiling a large pot of salted water and cooking 
        your spaghetti according to the package instructions. While the pasta is cooking, 
        heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. 
        Sauté chopped onions and minced garlic until they turn golden and fragrant. 
        This step adds a nice depth of flavor to the sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Next, add your choice of ground meat</strong>, such as beef, pork, or a mix, to the skillet, 
        breaking it up with a spoon. Cook the meat until browned, then pour in a can of crushed tomatoes. 
        Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and dried Italian herbs like basil and oregano. 
        Let the sauce simmer for 10–15 minutes to blend the flavors, stirring occasionally. 
        If you prefer a bit of spice, add a pinch of red pepper flakes.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Once the pasta is ready</strong>, drain it and add it directly to the skillet, 
        tossing it with the sauce to coat evenly. Finish the dish by adding 
        a handful of fresh basil or parsley for a fresh touch. Serve the spaghetti 
        with a generous sprinkle of grated Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of olive oil. 
        Enjoy this classic Italian dish with a side of garlic bread or a green salad.
